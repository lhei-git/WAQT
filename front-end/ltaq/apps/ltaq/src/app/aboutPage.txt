            One of the major silent killers and reducers of quality of life in
            the world today is air pollution. The European Environmental Agency
            considers air pollution “the biggest environmental health risk in
            Europe.” Studies indicate that in general, “air pollution is one of 
            the most important reasons for serious human health effects including
            cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses” Long-term exposure of
            simply being downwind of a highway can significantly reduce life
            years3. Moreover, likely due to climate change, growing wildfires
            are exacerbating air pollution around the world.

          While many applications exist to report current levels of air pollutants, 
          these applications do not provide historical trends of pollution and air 
          quality for specific places or regions. For example, while it is possible 
          to view real-time data of air quality measures for a particular place, 
          via applications such as AirNow and IQAir, current web applications do 
          not enable visualization of air quality trends in the previous 5 or 7 years.

          Although wildfires have become a serious concern, particularly in the United States 
          (US), where wildfire burned 4 million acres in 2020 in California. However, few current 
          applications exist to visualize current active wildfires and historic information about 
          wildfires in the US.
          <br />
          <div>
          The Wildfire & Air Quality Tracker (WAQT) app was developed to provide citizens, scientists, 
          policy makers and the public alike the ability to easily search for air quality and wildfire 
          information for a particular county of interest (currently in the US only). WAQT provides a 
          location’s current air quality measures for Ozone, PM2.5 and PM10—some of the most common air 
          pollutants—based on the US Air Quality Index (AQI). This information is retrieved from the [XYZ] 
          application programming interface (API) of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  
          </div>
          <br />
          <div>
          WAQT also retrieves the current active wildfires in the searched location from the [XYZ] API, 
          of the National Interagency Fire Center, and various calculations of historical wildfire data 
          for the searched location, and the entire state, from the Wildland Fire Locations Full History 
          API of the National Interagency Fire Center. 
          </div>
          <br />
          <div> 
          The WAQT app also produces various graphs of the historical trends of the three major pollutants 
          identified from the year 2015 until the most recent data available. This long-term air quality 
          data is pulled from the US EPA Air Quality System (AQS). The application also visualizes historical 
          trends of wildfires, including total wildfires and acres burned from wildfires—when the data is available. 
          Further details about wildfire data calculations are provided below.
          </div>
          <br /> 
          <div>
          WAQT was conceptualized by Nic DePaula, who guided the development process. WAQT was developed by 
          Ryan Kaszubski, Ahmad Aoun and Kevin Kluka during the Fall of 2022 for their senior capstone project.

          <br/>
          <div>
          EPA sets national air quality standards for 6 common pollutants, 3 of which are measured 
          by WAQT given their prominence in issues of air quality:

              This project will focus on web application development, web
              hosting, database development, data analysis and data
              visualization. Students may select language and technologies of
              choice. AWS resources may be provided for development and hosting.
              While this will be a new stand-alone application, students may
              build on a previously developed application to analyze air
              temperature data, RAFT.
